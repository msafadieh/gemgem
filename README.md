# gemgem

A basic, multi-threaded gemini server

## WARNING

Do not use in production. I only wrote this to learn more about TCP/IP and Python sockets.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+

## Usage

An SSL certificate and private key are mandatory per the Gemini specifications. By default, the server will bind to all available interfaces on **port 1965**. The default queue size is 32 and the default thread count is 4.
